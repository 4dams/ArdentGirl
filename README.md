# TwitchBot
This is my small personal Twitch-Bot which I run on my own Twitch account.
- [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/mr4dams)
- Website/Command lists (WIP!)
- Latest Release (WIP!)  
  
It got some nice features such as informational commands, fun commands and even League of Legends related commands which grant you a lot of information about a specific Summoner!  
  
*Just a quick note: You will need a [Riot Games API Key](https://developer.riotgames.com) in order to use the League commands!*

## Available Commands

### League Commands
- [X] "!elo" sends current league information about the streamer
- [X] "!winrate" calculates a users current winrate and then sends it in chat
- [X] "!topchamps" displays a summoners top 3 champions (name, level and mastery score)
- [X] "!rank1" shows some info about the defined servers Rank 1 Challenger
- [X] "!status" provides a list of League's server status and warning, if there are any
- [X] "!livegame" displays info about the streamers current game (runes wip)


### Default Commands
- [X] "!commands" to get a list of all commands
- [X] "!info" gives some info about the bot itself
- [X] "!myelo" a fun command which returns a random elo
- [X] "!zeit" sends the streamers current time
- [X] "!8ball" for responding with a random string (yes/no/maybe...)
- [X] "!vanish" to remove all messages from yourself
- [ ] "!addcommand `<trigger> <response>`" lets you add a new command via chat
- [ ] "!chatstats" or "!emotestats" to see how much a specific emote/string has been used
- [ ] "!permit" permit users to post links (the bot will otherwise delete all links)
- [ ] "!setsummoner" to save info about a channels default summoner

*Note: Those commands have been adjusted for one special streamer but you can change and adjust them as much as you want, even though they're in german.*

## To Do

- Split commands into single files

## Installation

```
// Tmi.js
npm i tmi.js

// Moment.js
npm i moment

// Request
npm i request
```

Other than that, you will have a file called "config.json" where you can set all your information such as:  
  
1. Your Riot API token
2. Your Twitch OAuth token
3. Channel names
  
The Riot API token can be retrieved at https://developer.riotgames.com/.</br>
Your Twitch OAuth token can be found at https://twitchapps.com/tmi/.</br>
  
You will then have to fill in your tokens and other information into the `config.json`.
  
After you have done that, you can simply start the bot with `node app.js` in the directory where the app.js is located in!
