<h1 align="center">ArdentGirl Twitch Bot</h1>
  
This got some nice features such as informational commands, fun commands and even a bunch of League of Legends related commands* which serve you a lot of information about the streamer or other summoners!  
  
* *LoL related commands require a [Riot Games API key](https://developer.riotgames.com)!*

## Some Available Commands

### League Commands

| Command        | Description           | Usage  |

| !winrate | Shows the winrate of a summoner, if no name is given, shows the winrate of the streamer | `!winrate [<summoner name>]` |

### Default Commands
- [X] "!commands" to get a list of all commands
- [X] "!info" gives some info about the bot itself
- [X] "!myelo" a fun command which returns a random elo
- [X] "!zeit" sends the streamers current time

- [ ] "!setsummoner" to save info about a channels default summoner

*Note: Those commands have been adjusted for one special streamer but you can change and adjust them as much as you want, even though they're in german.*

## To Do

- Split commands into single files

## Installation

```
// Tmi.js
npm i tmi.js

// Moment.js
npm i moment

// Request
npm i request
```

Other than that, you will have a file called "config.json" where you can set all your information such as:  
  
1. Your Riot API token
2. Your Twitch OAuth token
3. Channel names
  
The Riot API token can be retrieved at https://developer.riotgames.com/.</br>
Your Twitch OAuth token can be found at https://twitchapps.com/tmi/.</br>
  
You will then have to fill in your tokens and other information into the `config.json`.
  
After you have done that, you can simply start the bot with `node app.js` in the directory where the app.js is located in!
